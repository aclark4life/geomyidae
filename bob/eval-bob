# Don't drink and code.
# Eval BOB!
#
# https://www.bob.be/
#
# We want to create awareness of people writing code while being drunken.
# See PHP or Ruby on Rails for how to not do it. You will end up in a
# life of misery, where you cannot escape and need to keep going until
# your pension with some ugly language, reinventing what has been done
# before. Noone will remember you, since you write shit code and the next
# hype kid replaced your idea with their own hype, rewriting what you
# already did.
#
# Example BOB file:
#
#	<?geomyidae echo hello bob ?>
#
# See index.bob for an example file.
